# Intro to React

My solution to the tutorial [Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) (we build a small tic-tac-toe game).

It  doesnâ€™t assume any existing React knowledge.

It is for people who prefer **learn by doing**.

## What Are We Building ?

We've created a tic-tac-toe game that:

* Let's you play tic-tac-toe,
* Indicates when a player has won the game,
* Stores a game's history as the game progresses,
* Allow players to review a game's history and see previous version of the game's board.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo, install dependencies then start the processus.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/toutane/intro-to-react.git
cd intro-to-react
npm install
npm start
```

Congratulations! You can know play tic-tac-toe on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
